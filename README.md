i am an 84.5 y/o assembler and C# programmer looking to learn new things in my dotage. 
I want to develop an interactive web page and i have gotten to creating a page with 2 text
fields and 1 button. When i click the button i want to send the 2 fields and the button namer
to the server. I can do this using the 'form' tag and at the server i can see the field contents
and the button name.  How do i reply to the client with the swapped fields? 
How does the client javascript see the reply? 
This is a long winded intro but i need some help.
